# RestaurantNameAndMenuGenerator
 This Streamlit based web-app gives out the restaurant name and its menu dynamically depending upon the type of cuisine selected.
 
This project is made using Langchain which helps to develop applications using LLM's.I have used the concepts like chains,sequential chains,prompt templates and temperature.
